such uses would be permitted if the MetaHuman Characters were licensed to you as
MetaHuman Content under the Epic Content License Agreement available at
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/content. This means, for example, that
MetaHuman Characters may only be used in conjunction with Unreal Engine and Unreal
Engine-based products as designated by Epic, such as Twinmotion.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF A EPIC PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WILL BE TO IMMEDIATELY

DOLLARS ($10.00). The foregoing disclaimer of warranties, disclaimer of certain

that those laws apply to this License Agreement, the exclusions and limitations set
forth above may not apply to you.

notice, terminate this License Agreement at any time for convenience. Unless

courts (without affecting either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if

the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply
to this License Agreement. This Section 9 will be interpreted as broadly as applicable
law permits.

License Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and

Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision
is deemed severable from this License Agreement and does not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions.

this License Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right, remedy or provision.
All waivers of any terms or conditions in this License Agreement must be in writing
signed by Epic.

between Epic and You with respect to the Software and the subject matter hereof
