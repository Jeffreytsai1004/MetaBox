# importCurves
Imports Curves that were Exported using the Export Button.
NOTE: Only import files that were exported using Export Curves button.
WARNING: This operation is NOT undoable!

# exportCurves
Exports selected curves into a .curves (or .ma) file. Can then be Imported using Import Curves.

# changeScaleFactor
Opens a window that controls the Scale Factor.
Scale factor determines the initial scale of the created curve and adjusts other parameters.
Scale factor is stored in a global preset, in the scene and on each curve.
Priority of scale factors Curve>Scene>Global.
NOTE: Using the correct scale factor can help with the control of the curves and helps in avoiding bugs due to very large or very small scenes.

# globalCurveThickness
Opens a window that controls the thickness of the curves in the scene as well as the global curve thickness preset across the scenes.

# setAOSettings
Manually sets the recommended AO settings for older Maya versions.
These AO settings are needed to use the "See Through" or "Toggle Always on Top" functions.
Are applied automatically by those functions.

# setTransparencySettings
Sets recommended transparency settings for Maya viewport.
***
Simple Transparency is fast but very inaccurate render mode. Only suitable for simple, one layer hair.
Object Sorting Transparency has average performance impact and quality. Can have issues on complex multi-layered grooms.
Depth Transparency - these are the optimal settings for the highest quality of the hair cards preview. Can have performance impact on slower systems.

# convertToWarpCard

# groupTemplateCollections
Collections that have "template" in their name (case insensitive) will be grouped together into "CT_Templates" group by Regroup By Layer function.

2. Ctrl+D and Shift+P the curve (not the curve group).
3. Click Curve Card and the twist value will be restored on a newly created card.

This option will also flip the UVs back when using Unbind for better workflow.
Disabling this option will result in an old Bind/Unbind behaviour.

# populateBlendAttributes
Enables blending of the attributes when using Add Cards/Tubes or Fill functions.

This will have no effect on older versions of Maya (<2020). This bug is native to Maya and thus canâ€™t be fixed in GS CurveTools plug-in.

# mayaFixBrokenGraphs
This function will attempt to fix all the broken graphs in the scene.
Use if one of the graphs (Width, Twist or Profile) is in a broken state.

# convertBezierToNurbs
Converts the selected Bezier curves to NURBS curves.

# maya2020TwistAttribute
This function will fix any broken cards created in Maya 2020.4 before v1.2.2 update.

# maya2020UnbindFix
This function will fix any cards that are not unbinding properly and were created before v1.2.3 update in Maya 2020.4.

# deleteAllAnimationKeys
This function will delete all the animation keys on all the curves present in the scene.
This can fix deformation issues when using duplicate or other GS CurveTools functions.
Some functions (like duplicate) will delete the keys automatically, however the keys can still cause issues.
