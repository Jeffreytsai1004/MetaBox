We (the licensor of the Product) represent and warrant that where the Product was created using Generative AI Programs, we have applied the “CreatedWithAI” tag. Under this Agreement, a Product is considered to be created using Generative AI Programs where a material portion of a Product is generated with Generative AI Programs, whether characters, backgrounds, or other material elements. A Product is not considered to be created using Generative AI Programs merely for use of features that solely operate on a Product (e.g., AI-based upscaling or content-aware fill).
