This version of CreasePlus is rewritten entirely in python cmds(maya) and API's.
thus there is no longer support for MayaLT. And the run-in lang is Python.

install :
extract, then just place icon and main folders in documents/maya/(maya_version)/scripts/
restart maya if opened.

#
# attach it as python script / runtime command to hotkey:
import maya.cmds as cmds
from CreasePlus import CreasePlusMain
CreasePlusMain.start()

if not cmds.pluginInfo("CreasePlusNodes", q=True, loaded=True):
    cmds.loadPlugin("CreasePlusNodes.py")


# attach it as python script / runtime command to hotkey, for attribute iteration in context (optional):
from CreasePlus import CreasePlusMain
CreasePlusMain.crepcore.creasePlusLastCtx()

# attach it as python script / runtime command to hotkey, for edge soft/hard toggle (optional):
from CreasePlus import CreasePlusMain
CreasePlusMain.crepcore.creasePlusToggleEdgeSmooth()
