There are folders with the different Maya versions. You have to use the correct 32 bit or 64 bit version, depending on what version of Maya you're running.


Make a new shelf button

loadPlugin -qt "C:/Users/yourname/Documents/AnimSchoolPicker/AnimSchoolPicker/2020 (the version of Maya you're using)/AnimSchoolPicker.mll";
AnimSchoolPicker();

You can use the PickerIcon.png image for the Maya icon.


Mac:


loadPlugin -qt "/Users/yourname/AnimSchoolPicker.bundle";
AnimSchoolPicker();
